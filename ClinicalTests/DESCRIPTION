Description: The package provides 3 functions. The first function (function1)computes simultaneously clinical and epidemiological characteristics including tests' sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, incidence rate, and prevalence. Function2 outputs a panel that helps to have a glance (scatter plots)at the relation between CD4 count and viral load in groups of patients on different drug types. Function3 also outputs a panel with free scale plots (scatter plots) evaluating the same relation, with the corresponding box plots.
